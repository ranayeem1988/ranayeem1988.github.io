        <h2>Bio:</h2>

            <p>American quartet Metallica were one of the most influential heavy metal bands of the '80s and '90s, inspiring
            generations of rockers with their early thrash and later hard rock sounds before settling into their roles as a
            popular legacy act in the 2000s. Responsible for bringing the metal genre back to earth, the bandmates looked and
            talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the mid-'80s
            pop-metal renaissance. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake,
            but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983's Kill 'Em All marked the beginning
            of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each
            album, the band's playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched
            his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the
            package, Lars Ulrich's thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton's innovative bass
            playing.
